# The net stack
{: .no_toc }

A Nimony-native networking stack, one concern per repo, layered `tcp → net →
tls → serve` with transport-free `http`/`compress` helpers and `ws` / `requests`
alongside. Common stance throughout: nimony-native, no framework runtime,
**status-based errors instead of exceptions**, blocking I/O by default with a
non-blocking escape hatch on every handle. **TLS 1.3**, **dual-stack IPv6**, a
**concurrent worker pool**, **HTTP/2**, **WebSocket**, and **HTTP/3** (client)
are all first-class.

## How it layers

```
requests   (HTTP client — curl-impersonate; HTTP/2 + HTTP/3, browser-identical)

ws         (WebSocket, RFC 6455 — ws:// and wss://, server + client)

serve      (HTTP/1.1 + HTTP/2 server; HTTPS; concurrent pool; compression)  ┐
  ├── http (transport-free: headers, URL/form, parsing, status)             │
  ├── compress (gzip / brotli / zstd codecs)                                │  consumed
  ├── tls  (TLS 1.3 over OpenSSL 3 — client + server)   ┐                    │  by serve
  └── net  (Socket / dual-stack IPv6 / dial)           │ tls wraps a Socket  │
        └── tcp (native sockets: IPv4 + IPv6)          ┘                     ┘
```

`http` and `compress` are deliberately **out** of the transport chain — no
sockets — so any transport can reuse them. `tls` sits beside `net` (it wraps a
`net.Socket`), and `serve` / `ws` build on both.
